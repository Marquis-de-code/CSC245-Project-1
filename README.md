# CSC245-Project-1
This is the code for _Project 1: Write program to print out an Object's Fields_ for my CSC245 Secure Software Development course. It is designed to print out the fields/instance variables of an example class.

## Requirements
Write a program using Java Reflection to print out its field (or instance) variables. Just print out its name, you don't need to print out the variable's value.
